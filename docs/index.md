# About

This is a continuation of my [original contribution](https://github.com/pixelfed/pixelfed/pull/4844) of a reworked Docker/Compose system for Pixelfed.

This project is consolidating the original work, planned improvements, and documentation into one place, where I and hopefully others, can freely iterate and improve on the Pixelfed + Docker experience.

It's still in the early setup and consolidation phase, so some things might link incorrectly or have out of date information.
